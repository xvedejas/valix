; This function is some magic to basically get past the C type system and pass
; arbitrary arguments of arbitrary type to a function of arbitrary type.
; Instead, we rely on the VM's ability to check types and perform implicit
; conversions by sending messages to objects to obtain the desired C type if an
; object is given instead.
